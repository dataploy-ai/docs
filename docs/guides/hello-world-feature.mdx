# Hello World feature

Creating a feature is as simple as specifying a YAML file.  Here's an example of a minimal [feature definition](../reference/how-does-raptor-work/features/feature-definitions.md):

```yaml
apiVersion: k8s.raptor.ml/v1alpha1
kind: Feature
metadata:
  name: hello-world
spec:
  primitive: string
  freshness: 1h
  staleness: 2h
  builder:
    kind: expression
    pyexp: |-
      def handler(**req):
         return "Hello world " + req["entity_id"]
```

The `spec` specifies how the feature should be calculated: we're using a simple expression [builder](../reference/how-does-raptor-work/feature-builders/)
to run our [PythonExpression](../reference/pyexp/).<br />
The feature above would evaluate the string `Hello world Almog` as the feature value when the entity_id `Almog` is requested.


Now, after we've built our very first "hello-world" feature, it's time to build something more advanced ðŸ¤©
