# How does Natun work?

Data Scientists use Natun to describe and deploy Features to Production, without drowning in engineering specifics.

To achieve that Natun must be able to understand the logic of the Feature, and to create and configure the engineering setup based on that.

* Natun allows Data Scientists to write the logic in their favorite languages - such as Python and SQL.
* Data Scientists can then specify engineering aspects such as "how fresh should this data be" or "in case of error, use this value" - in a declarative language understandable to Engineers and to Natun.

The bundle of the feature logic and engineering aspects is called the **Feature Definition**, it is described in a YAML file ("as code"), and Natun uses it to create the actual features and calculate feature values in production.

Feature Definitions are usually stored in Git, which carries benefits such as review and comparison for every change, an ability to see previous versions, and others. When Git is used, it becomes the "source of truth" for the feature definitions.

However, Feature Definitions only become Features after Natun Operator spins off the necessary compute, connections, and storage resources. The organization's CI/CD systems deploy the Feature Definitions to the Kubernetes cluster. In simpler setups, the deployment can be done manually using `kubectl apply`.

Natun Operator then discovers these Feature definitions and uses Feature Builders to configure the resources needed for the Feature. Such resources include connectors to external sources, storage resources, and compute resources.  This is the final step - once done, the Feature is live and models can access it.
