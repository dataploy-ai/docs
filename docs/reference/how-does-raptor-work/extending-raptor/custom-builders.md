# Custom Builders

Raptor Operator uses Builders to create live Features. Builders use a low-level API of Raptor to configure everything from data connections through computation, aggregation to storage, as well as production and SLA requirements for the feature.

Raptor believes in the power of the community, and it extensible by design. Raptor is a highly versatile tool - and part of its versatility is its support for Custom Builders, which any organization or user can create to support new kinds of Feature Definitions.

More information on Custom Builders is coming soon, so stay tuned!
